      <p>There are 5 main asset classes</p>
<p><strong>1. Equity</strong> (Stocks, Ownership) – It can be bought, sold and it can generate cash in the form of dividends. It can be priced and valued.</p>
<p><strong>2. Debt</strong> (Bonds) – Same as with Equity, it can be bought and sold, and generates cash in the form of interests. It can be priced and valued.</p>
<p><strong>3. Assets</strong> (Realestate, Commodities) – Can be valued and priced, can generate cash (Rent from real estate) but that’s an exception.</p>
<p><strong>4. Currency</strong> – It can only be priced. Valuing a currency is tricky. The base for any currency to have value is trust and the strength of the underlying economy.</p>
<p><strong>5.Collectables</strong> (Art, Cars, Jewellery…) – Can only be priced and a key driver of their price is rarity. How to determine the real value of a DaVinci or an Aston Martin  DB4 Zagato?</p>
<p>Some can be valued, some can be prices and some can be both valued and prices. What are the differences?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p><strong>Value</strong> – The key drivers of value are cash flows, market position, growth, risk. Its more objective than price, since it doesn’t depend on market forces of demand and supply.  The price can fluctuate, but the value is more or less constant.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong> – Key drivers of price are demand and supply, which are dependent on mood, momentum and future expectations. Its a lot more subjective than Value.</p>
<p>So what are cryptos?</p>
<p>They are not currencies for one simple reason there is a very limited number of items that one can buy using cryptos. How many items can you purchase using only Bitcoins? Items that are priced in Bitcoins and can be bought using only Bitcoins without using an exchange, and without pegging the prices to another currency. Can I buy a 6 pack of beer at 0,01 Bitcoin no mather the BTC/USD exchange rate? Maybe somewhere, but it’s not ubiquitous. There is no scale behind it.</p>
<p>It’s not Equity, it’s not Debt. Since it doesn’t give you any legal claim to anything.</p>
<p>A commodity? Some people call it internet gold, but gold has value and is used for more than just a store of value. As a store of value cryptocurrencies are shit since they are way to volatile.</p>
<p>Not a collectable, let’s just leave it at that.</p>
<p>The future of cryptocurrencies is an alternative to cash. Not a store of value, but a medium to transfer value. A medium which is private, and runs parallel to our current currency system, but away from the wondering eyes of the proverbial government.</p>
<p>How will the transition look like, and which token will be the dominant one is hard to tell. My best guess right now is Bitcoin. It has the network effect, it has the name recognition and people are familiar enough with it to actually buy it.</p>
<p>What’s lacking is a market for goods and services priced exclusively in cryptocurrencies, and a stable enough exchange rate that there is no incentive for speculation. This will all come in time, when exactly and at what USD/BTC price point this no speculation exchange rate will be formed I have no idea. But what I am certain of is that growing government surveillance spurned on by the COVID-19 epidemic will accelerate this, just as it has proved to be a catalyst for numerous other societal changes.</p>
